Gedit Right Pane Plugin
Copyright (C) 2009 Tournier Guillaume <tournier.guillaume@gmail.com>

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1) Extract contents of archive
2) Copy files from gedit-rightpane directory to
   ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins
   Create-it if not exists
3) Fire up gedit, go to Edit->Preferences, select the
   Plugins tab, and make sure "Right Pane" is checked
   
TROUBLESHOOTING
- If you try to move tabs on right pane just after installation, you can have a segfault when you'll close gedit.
- Actually it depends of the tab you moved. So, to avoid that, restart gedit just after rightpane installation ;-)
