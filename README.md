= Collection of plugins, themes for Gedit-2 =

Here are some nice plugins and themes I collected for Gedit-2.  One
goal of this repo it to make them work on [Gedit-2](https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) & Pluma (fork for
[the MATE desktop](http://mate-desktop.org/)) for Linux, and [Gedit-2 for Windows](https://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Windows).
