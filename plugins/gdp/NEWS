gdp-0.4.1 (2.30.0): Pydoc proprosals in completions
===================================================

This release added pydoc to the completion details. The complete pydoc for
modules, classes, and members is presented the the details window when
completing python code.


gdp-0.4.0 (2.30.0): Update to GTKSourceView Completions
=======================================================

This release replaces the snippet-based completer with a GTKSourceView-based
CompletionProvider.

    * The python completer has rudimentary documentation in the info window
      that you can see using the Details button. This feature will be
      improved in future releases.
    * Find searches application and xml files like javascript. Find was
      skipping some file types that gedit can edit that do not have the
      text/* mime-type.
    * A bug that caused an exception when the syntax completer closed a
      tag is now fixed.


gdp-0.3.1 (2.28.0): Markup completion
=====================================

This release adds XML-based markup completion.

    * Detection is based on the language/highlighting of the document.
      The supported languages are: XML, XSLT, HTML, Mallard, Docbook, and
      Zope page templates.
    * When opening a tag, the completer suggests other open or empty tags
      that are already in the document.
    * When closing a tag, the complete suggests the tags that are still open
      before the cursor. This is helpful, though not perfect. The root element
      for example, will always be listed since it is closed at the end of the
      document.
    * When the adding an attribute, the completer suggests the attributes that
      were used in other tags.
    * You still need to know the markup's grammatical rules since elements
      and attributes are suggested from context rather than schema.
    * The implementation could be extended to suggest elements and attributes
      for specific grammars.

Important changes.

    * The completion key accelerator has changed from <Control><Shift>Space to
      <Control>Slash (Ctrl+/) to avoid conflicts with HTML snippet commands.



gdp-0.2 (2.28.0): UI and stability improvements
===============================================

This release improves the user experience of the four plugins:

    * The Multi-file find and replace panel and style and syntax panel were
      repositioned to the side. The side panels are more likely to be open and
      it is easier to read line numbers in the panel and see the line numbers
      in the documented at the same time.
    * Syntax completion is now available from the Tools menu. If the syntax
      completer detects a syntax error, it will signal the Format plugin
      to show the Syntax and style panel.
    * Search results can be saved to file. The panel saves your previous
      entries so that they can be repeated.
    * The Bazaar plugin supports all the bzr-gtk GUI functions, notably you
      can create new branches and perform checkouts.
    * Multiple files can be checked for syntax and style issues.

There are some implementation/build issues that were resolved:

    * The XML checker uses the standard python library, no additional
      installations are needed.
    * Snippets and external tools were removed -- they were not useful for
      general distribution and they could overwrite person snippets and
      tools :(

For developers there is an autogen.sh to build the project from source.

gdp-0.1 (2.26.1): The first release
===================================

Gedit-developer-plugins (GDP) are a set of plugins for gedit that provide
additional editing features for software development. GDP provides:

    * Multi-file find and replace
      Directories and file types can be specified. Regular expressions are
      supported.
    * Syntax completion
      Python completion using the file's imports and definitions. Simple
      word completion based on the words in the file.
      Use <Shift><Control>Space to activate the snippet completer window.
    * Formatting
      Format paragraphs, lists, and imports. Reformat test using regular
      expressions. Check the syntax and style of Python, XML, and plain
      text. Check and reformat Python doctests.
    * Project management via Bazaar DVCS
      integrates bzr-gtk to show status, tags, annotations, visualize,
      commit, merge, and push. Open files changes in the branch.
