2007-09-01  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[61] Revised the _calculateSyntaxViewPosition() test to use a dummy

	for the last check because screen width's vary.

2007-08-31  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[60] Replaced the source tuple with just the gedit.Document because it
	has all the infomation added to sources.

	good at providing adhoc data.

2007-08-30  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[54] Moved the testing doctests to tests to ensure that they are run.

	writing of both source of data.

2007-08-28  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[46] Renamed mock.* to fake.*. In the long term, the fake class
	generator will need both stub and mock features, but they will be
	provided by testing so that code need not be regenerated when testing
	features are added.

2007-08-26  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[45] Moved mockgen to testing

2007-08-26  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[43] Removed test hook hack. Tests for the controller are complete.

	SyntaxController. Refactored a few methods.

	and snippet dependancies.

2007-08-13  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[36] Reworded mock testing. Not a very good session. However, if/when
	gtk.main() is run after controller.show_completion(), the feature will
	really run in an interactive session.

2007-08-12  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[35] Moved heleprs to new modules testing. Added base test for
	SyntaxController. Method testing is needed.

	[24] Refactored syntax completer.

2007-07-26  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	Everything needs another round of naming.

2007-07-25  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[22] Moved tests into gdp. Removed the forced addition of the prefix
	to the SyntaxModel because that is something else's responsability.

2007-07-22  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[21] Extended tests. Clean up SyntaxControler. I need to understand it
	better to write tests and create logic that is needed for syntax
	completion.

2007-07-21  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>

	[20] Hooked TextModel into CompleteModel.

2007-07-21  Curtis Hovey <curtis.hovey@canonical.com>
