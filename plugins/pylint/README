gedit-pylint
============

gedit-pylint is a small Python plugin to use pylint
(http://www.logilab.org/pylint) inside GNOME's Gedit editor.

This plugin is a proof-of-concept to add more Python development
capabilities to Gedit. Please look at TODO for a updated list of things
todo so gedit-pylint can become a full pylint solution for Gedit.


INSTALLATION:

Just put 'pylint.gedit-plugin' file and 'pylint' directory on your
$HOME/.gnome2/gedit/plugins. Then use Gedit Plugin Manager to activate
the plugin.

(a setup.py would be nice... I am working on it :)
