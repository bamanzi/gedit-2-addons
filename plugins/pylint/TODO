gedit-pylint TODO
=================

In random order:

        * better pylint results parser - DONE

        * use GEditStatusBar flash_message to display feedback (not in
          pyton binding yet?) - DONE (patch submited)

        * config manager to select which kind of
          errors/warning/conventions to lookup and highlight

        * better results list with icons to different kind of errors,
          double-click support (goto error line), sortable list,
          filterable based on error kind. - IN PROGRESS

        * easy way to disable highlight of errors (just leave on
          results list)

        * configurable keybind

        * configurable highlight colors

        * interactive mode: run pylint as soon as user entered a line
          (just like spell plugin)

        * add underline-color, strikethrough-color to GtkTextTag
          (Pango supports but Gtk doesn't expose)
